        <div class="UAE">
            <h3>United Arab Emirates</h3>
            <p>Dubai is the very first place I visited as a toddler, my parents still show me pictures of when they visited Dubai. When I went to Dubai more recently,
                it felt as if it was my second home because our cultures are very similar and everyone was very polite. When we went to the UAE recently, we visited 
                Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi and it was a very fun experience being able to go on every rollercoaster. We also did a lot of shopping in Yas Mall. It was the biggest 
                Mall I have ever seen it felt like we walked for hours and we weren't even half way through. Overall, I love being able to visit the country and hope to be able to 
                work there in the future since it is very close by to my family.</p>

        <div class="Thailand">
            <h3>Thailand</h3>
            <p>Thailand is one of the most beautiful countries when it comes to nature, I went to thailand at a young age and I vividly remember the elephants and the beaches.
                The beaches were extremely clean it was such a nice experience unlike other places in the world where there are rocks everywhere and it's uncomfortable to walk around.
                I remember my father and one of my sisters went paragliding over the beach but of course I was too scared to go up that high. The hotel that we stayed at made the 
                experience so much better, waking up in the morning to a baby elephant at your front door that you could pet and feed. They also had a very big swimming pool,
                a lazy river, tennis courts and many more activities. But my favorite activity was the Kickboxing classes, the coaches were very kind and made the activity extremely
                fun.</p>

        <div class="Iran">
            <h3>Iran</h3>
            <p>Iran is my parent's favorite country to visit, they enjoy going there to shop and visit new areas we haven't went to before. We have visited Iran more than five times 
                as a family. My favorite part of Iran is the weather. In winter, its extremely cold and it also snows very often, while in summer their temperatures are still very 
                cool and you could visit their water parks and parks. My favorite season to visit Iran is in the winter, since while it's snowing you see people eating ice cream 
                and cold snacks, what makes it even better is that you don't get sick there. We always get ice cream even when temperatures are in the negatives and I have never gotten 
                sick. Their scenery is also one of the most beautiful things I have witnessed, we went on a road trip and I saw many mountains in the summer covered in snow with 
                beautiful clouds. Not to mention, their foods are extremely good full of flavour and my favorite is kebab with rice. It contains the perfect amount of spices and salt.</p>

        <div class="Turkey">
            <h3>Turkey</h3>
            <p>Turkey is my favorite place to visit since whenever we visit turkey we always do a lot of shopping. Prices there are very cheap and I always buy hoodies and jackets
                whenever we visit its almost mandatory to go shopping in Istanbul. When we visited Antalya it was a completely different experience than Istanbul. Our hotel 
                was right next to a body of water and whenever u ate breakfast you could see the mountains across the water covered in snow. At night, you can see stars in the 
                sky it is still to this day my favorite country I have visited. Going to the top of the mountain where it was -15 degrees celsius, our phones batteries couldn't 
                handle such cold temperatures so there was no one using their phones everyone was just enjoying the experience and creating memories using their minds 
                instead of using their phones. The aeriel tramway or the telefrik as many people call it, is used to climb all the way to the top of one of the mountains. 
                As you go higher and high, your ears start to pop as if you are in an airplane and you slowly feel the temperatures changing. It is one of the most surreal 
                experiences, I remember in certain parts the snow would be at almost knee level. There were snowmobiles, people skiing and people just enjoying nature playing with 
                snowballs.</p>
