        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>Sports was and always will be apart of my life since I find I find it to be a fun way to stay healthy.
             Ever since I was in elementary school I remember playing football with my classmates. 
             Then as I grew taller I slowly transitioned to basketball and found myself playing it every week with my cousins and family. 
            I also enjoy swimming since it helps me clear my mind whenever I am stressed and works every muscle in the body. The sport that I achieved the most in is track & field, 
            I was apart of my highschool's track & field team. I competed in one tournament and received 5 medals, at the end of the tournament I found out that I was the fastest
            100m sprinter in all of Bahrain's Private Schools.</p>

        <div class="Video-games">
        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p> I started playing video games at a very young age, I remember playing Fifa on a Playstation 2 with my cousin and uncle, 
            I can admit that we always lost whenever we played against my uncle since we didn't know how to properly play. When I was in elementary, I received my 
            first personal gaming 
            console which was the Playstation 3, during elementary school I met one of my best friends to this day we talked and played video games everyday. 
            I remember the hangouts where we 
            would visit each other's houses and just sit and play video games for hours. My favorite game of all time is Black Ops 2, I will forever hold on to the memories and 
            cherish them. Spending so much time on the game with friends and strangers on the internet a concept that I once couldn't grasp who knew that It would turn into such 
            a big part of my life. Nowadays, I own a gaming pc and play exploration, racing and shooter games. Racing in video games is very fun since I can race against my 
            friends with no consequences and its very immersive with the right equipment. Racing cars in virtual reality is the best experience in my opinion I find myself playing 
            for hours and I don't notice. Below are some games that I recommend playing:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Icarus</li>
                <li>The Forest</li>
                <li>Assetto Corsa</li>
                <li>Nba 2K23</li>
                <li>Call of Duty MW II</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="Trading">
        <h3>Trading</h3>
        <p> I got into trading cryptocurrency late 2019, I believe that it is a very valuable skill to have in life. I enjoy trading since its a game of probabilities 
            and possibilities, it requires a lot of attention and smart decision making. Cryptocurrency is also a very new topic when compared to stocks so I believe that it 
            could be a big part of our future especially with the idea of web 3 floating around with all of it's possibilities. I hope that trading cryptocurrency could help me 
            transition to stocks since the idea of trading stocks intrigues me since it is much safer when compared to other trading opportunities.</p>

        <div class="Shows">
            <h3>Tv Shows</h3>
        <p> Ever since the lockdown, I started watching many TV shows and Anime. I found myself free with a lot of free time, that is when I started watching Anime, 
            I never thought I would be the type of person to watch any type of series because I used to prefer movies over a TV series. One day, my friends were watching 
            an Anime called Black Clover and they invited me to join and just try watching it with them. Little did I know that I would get hooked on the series and enjoyed 
            relaxing for a couple hours and taking my mind off all the stress that comes daily. I told myself, I can stay inside in the comfort of my home and just watch an 
            episode or two. But what happened that week is that I watched 113 episodes of anime which is the equivalent of 37 hours. Below is a list of some Anime's that I recommend:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Black Clover</li>
                <li>Attack on Titan</li>
                <li>Jujutsu Kaisen</li>
                <li>Demon Slayer</li>
                <li>Vinland Saga</li>
            </ul>
